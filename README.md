# tic-tac-toe

This project generates a 3x3 grid where the game is played. Once the grid is generated, the user is prompted to input their name, which is then displayed above the grid.
Player clicks on square, and their icon, 'X' or 'O', is placed on respective square. Once, player clicks on square, it becomes the second player's turn and so on. To win, 
one player must a row, either horzintally or diagonally. If no three squares can be filled by the same icon, then it ends as a tie. You can then press on reset button to restart the game.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

For this project I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on JavaScript. The first intial challenge was to have a function that creates the player, takes in their name, and assigns them an icon.
